## Project Overview

The Purpose of this project is to assess the access of Justice and Social Support Services for Women, Children and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in Plateau & Abia States, Nigeria.

### Objectives:
Specifically, the project intends to:

a.	Evaluate the Disability Rights Law and how robust and all-encompassing the provisions of these laws are, compared to the Federal equivalent or to the equivalent law in states who are more advanced in access to justice reforms for vulnerable citizens such as Lagos State. 

b. The number of functional justice and social support services and the extent to which they are functional or non-functional prior to RoLAC intervention in the state. 

c.	The number of Guidelines, Practice Directions, Operational Protocols etc. that have been adopted by the state government, or any of their agencies (prior to intervention of the RoLAC Programme) that enhances access to justice, for women, children, victims of violence and persons with disabilities. 

d.	The number of persons receiving justice and social support services provided by Disability Desks in MDAs; Disability/VAPP/Child Rights Commission or Implementation Committees etc.

## Source of Data
The data was gotten from discussions, interview and Focal Group Discussion (FGD) with women, Child Protection Network and relevant CSOs and stakeholders in were conducted. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1.	How robust is the VAPP, Disability Rights Law and Child Rights Law is in Plateau and Abia State, Nigeria? 

2.	What is the number of functional justice and social support services and the extent to which they are functional or non-functional prior to RoLAC intervention in the state?

3.	What is the number of Guidelines, Practice Directions, Operational Protocols etc. that have been adopted by the state government or any of their agencies prior to intervention of the RoLAC Programme 

4.	How many persons are receiving justice and social support services provided by Disability Desks in MDAs; Disability/VAPP/Child Rights Commission or Implementation Committees etc. 



## Data Analysis Procedure
1.	Data Entry

2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation

3.	Checking of Missing Values and replacement

4.	Data formatting

5.	Converting dataset (in xls format) into comma separated value (csv) format making it compatible for Python operations.

## Tools
1.	Excel
2.	Python
3.	IBM-SPSS
## Results and Findings
1.	Both states face challenges in making justice services accessible and fair. Plateau shows a higher satisfaction rate with justice services at 37%, compared to Abia 35%, but both states also report substantial barriers for individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds. Additionally, transparency and fairness remain areas needing improvement, as both states report low satisfaction levels in these areas.

2.	Both Plateau and Abia States have social support services actively delivering aid, but their effectiveness remains below 50% for enabling access to justice for women and vulnerable groups. 

3.	Although both states have adopted some guidelines and protocols aimed at enhancing justice for women, children, and persons with disabilities, there is no evidence that these are actively being used. Plateau has adopted 20% of these instruments, and Abia has adopted 30%, but without any observed impact or changes in institutions. 

4.	Neither Plateau nor Abia State has provided training for individuals on implementing the VAPP Act, CRA or PWD Act. This lack of training includes not only general staff but also people with disabilities (PWDs) across all categories (physically, visually, hearing and intellectually impaired). 

## Recommendations
1.	Government should prioritize the implementation of existing guidelines and protocols designed to enhance justice for women, children and persons with disabilities. This should be by developing a comprehensive action plan that includes regular monitoring and evaluation of these measures, ensuring that they translate into tangible improvement in service delivery.

2.	Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) should focus on providing training programmes for justice and social support service personnel on the implementation of key legislation like the VAPP Act, CRA and PWD Act.

3.	Educational Institutions should incorporate training on justice and social support systems into their curricula particularly for students in law, social work and related fields. 

4.	Community leaders should engage in awareness campaigns that promote transparency and fairness in justice services. This should be in the area of dialogue within communities about the rights of women, children and persons with disabilities.
